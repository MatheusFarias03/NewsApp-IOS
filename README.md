# NewsApp - IOS

The NewsApp is an app that provides top news instantly on your phone with the use of News API (https://newsapi.org). At the home page you can get the current news in an table view, which the user can scroll down and see the most important news of the day. 

Each cell of this table view has an unique article, showing it's image, the article's title and a button to go to the article's page. 

There is also a search bar where the user can type a specific keyword and when pressing the search button it will show another screen containing the most relevant news that are related to the typed word.
